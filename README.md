# CS50-PSet-4-Filter

This is my code of the program that applies filters to BMPs, for Harvard's CS50 problems set 4.

## Specifications:

### Implement the functions in helpers.c such that a user can apply grayscale, sepia, reflection, or blur filters to their images.

1. The function grayscale should take an image and turn it into a black-and-white version of the same image.

2. The function sepia should take an image and turn it into a sepia version of the same image.

3. The reflect function should take an image and reflect it horizontally.

4. Finally, the blur function should take an image and turn it into a box-blurred version of the same image.
